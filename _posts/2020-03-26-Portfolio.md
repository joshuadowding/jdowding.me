After I'd returned to Anglia Ruskin University, I took on the role of Editor-in-Chief for the university's *only* student news outlet, The Ruskin Journal. Over the following trimesters, our [committee](https://www.angliastudent.com/socs/ruskinjournal/) grew the Journal by introducing it to the university's other campuses in London, Chelmsford and Peterborough. I oversaw the rebranding of both the website and the [student society](https://www.angliastudent.com/socs/ruskinjournal/), as well as the production of new promotional materials to help spread the word about the Journal. As a result, the Journal saw the highest number of readers in its short history, the team got to interview members of the local county council, and the website saw a regular swathe of content published every week. I'm incredibly proud of the work we've done to accomplish all of this and more this year.
