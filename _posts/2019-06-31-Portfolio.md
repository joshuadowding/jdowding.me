While working for MSX, I developed a total of six web portal products for our various different automotive clients to use as business intelligence tools in-the-field. Each web portal would have a means of viewing customer data including purchasing habits, previous purchases, current plans and more. They would also provide a means for management to share documents to the field agents.
