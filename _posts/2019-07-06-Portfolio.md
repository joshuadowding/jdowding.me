Esperus wanted to bring their website in-house; they had previously outsourced development of their website to a third-party, but it was time to take back control. To that end, and in colaboration with the whole team, I developed a replacement built from the ground up with ASP.NET.

What's interesting about esperus.com is that it also integrates with our in-house content management system. Allowing non-developers to make quick, non-destructive changes to the website content in real-time.
