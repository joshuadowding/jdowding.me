Esperus CLS evolved from a simple call tracker into a fully-fledged collection of business intelligence tools. It still serves the support team as their primary logging tool, but it also features a **contact and client database**, **integration with [esperus.com](https://esperus.com)**, and the ability to **run reports against various different datasets** like development requests, support tickets and bug reports. These can be exported, printed and shared across the company quickly and easily. Esperus CLS also tracks support response times, open ticket durations, call durations, ticket origins and much more.
