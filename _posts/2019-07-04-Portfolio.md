Esperus CLS evolved over-time from a simple suppot tracker into a fully-fledged business intelligence application. With the ability to run reports on development tickets, support tickets and client details, and generate reports for easy consumption. It also features an expanded support tracker with the ability to track response times, average support durations, ticket origins and more. As if that wasn't enough, Esperus CLS also acts as a contact and client database with the ability to associate client profiles with particular tickets. While I didnt start this project, I developed the vast majority of it's features over-time.
