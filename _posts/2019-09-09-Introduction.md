So when I went to start writing this blog post, I didn't know how to begin. I started reading other blogs to see how they started theirs; that didn't help. I watched a few videos on the subject; that didn't help. I read a number of articles on blogging and I started to feel bad about myself. Truth is I don't know how to write a blog, I don't know what I should talk about in a blog post, and I don't know how I should introduce myself. What should I share? What should I say? Who's going to read any of this? Initially, probably no-one.

The prevailing adivse is: state your name and introduce yourself (it's up top), say something about your current job or situation (I'm at uni), mention what you want to write about subject-wise (nerd stuff), set expectations by describing the sorts of posts that the reader can expect down-the-line (don't know), and try to market your content by differentiating it from other similar types of blog (that's impossible).

I fell for a particularly sensasionalised blog post titled 'This Is Exactly What Your First Blog Post Should Be About' - which talks about "captivating your audience", "hooking your audience", "being personal" with your audience, and ultimatly making them want to come back to your blog. As I read more of this type of article, the more I didn't want this to seem like work. These articles all assume I want to make money out of this; that I want to make a - dare I say - a "personal brand" out of this (I shudder at the thought). Truth is I don't. So none of these articles helped me at all.

Maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe I'm over-thinking this. Maybe this qualifies; running through my thought process as I try to answer these questions.
