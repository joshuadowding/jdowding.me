Esperus CMS provides basic content management for websites built with ASP.NET. It includes editors for text, images and links (external, internal and downloads), with dedicated editors for carousel slides and quote blocks provided as standard. Users can also upload assets to the asset bank which will make those assets available to their appropriate editors.

Esperus CMS works on the principle of "hotspots" within the HTML markup of a page. An injector would parse the current page, scan each hotspot tagged with a unique content ID, and then inject the appropriate content into that hotspot element at runtime.
