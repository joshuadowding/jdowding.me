Esperus CMS was the response to the need for a content management system that fit their preference for ASP.NET, and would be simple enough for a non-developer to use regularly. Esperus CMS can **edit text, images, links** (external, internal and downloads), and has **dedicated editors for carousel slides and quote blocks**. It has a **built-in asset manager** that provides components like the image gallery with a repository of assets that the user can upload to. And it also features a hierarchy that represents the structure of the website and allows for real-time content re-ordering.
