Between January 13th and July 12th, Lockhouse Games are hosting their inaugural Escape Room League. Throughout the second semester, each of the universities of Cambridge will compete against each other to see who can complete Lockhouse’s three escape rooms the quickest. Anglia Ruskin University has been invited to compete alongside Cambridge University, and it’s associated colleges, in a bout that is sure to stir up competition between the two institutions.
