Between January 13th and July 12th, Lockhouse Games are hosting their inaugural Escape Room League. Throughout the second semester, each of the universities of Cambridge will compete against each other to see who can complete Lockhouse’s three escape rooms the quickest. Anglia Ruskin University has been invited to compete alongside Cambridge University, and it’s associated colleges, in a bout that is sure to stir up competition between the two institutions.

According to Lockhouse’s website, each escape room has its own scoreboard and league table. Each team that declares itself to represent a particular university will be automatically inducted into the competition. The top three fastest times will contribute to the university’s overall average time for that given room, and this average will appear on the scoreboard should it be within the top three averages set by each of the universities. The faster you complete the room, the lower the average gets.

Lockhouse offers a ‘beginner-friendly’ experience for those who haven’t tried an escape room before. Their ‘Egyptian Tomb’ room boasts over 400 customer reviews granting it a five-star score on their website. Other rooms include the ‘Armageddon’ room and the ‘Secret Agent’ room, both featuring unique escape scenarios.

While Lockhouse have yet to formally announce the prizes for the winners of the competition, the company has hinted that they are working with local businesses to facilitate these prizes and that an announcement is forthcoming.

To participate in the league, Lockhouse encourages students to let them know that their team represents a given university when they book one of their escape rooms. This can be done in-person, or through the online booking form. And while there isn’t a minimum number of players for each team, their escape rooms do have a maximum capacity of either 6 or 7 players at a time.

Last bookings are at 9:40 PM on both weekdays and weekends, and Lockhouse also offers a number of student discounts when booking on certain days. Discounts are subject to the validation of a Student ID.

It sounds like a lot of fun, and we’ll be keeping an eye on the university’s progress over the coming weeks and months. Good luck to all the students who have already participated in the league, and to those who get involved throughout the remaining semester(s).

Thank you to Lockhouse Games for bringing this event to our attention.
