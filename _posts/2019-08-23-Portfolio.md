Forked from an [abandoned open-source project](https://github.com/teejee2008/ukuu), Noyau manages kernel updates for Ubuntu-based distributions; including both supported and un-supported kernel releases directly from Canonical. With a modern GTK3-based interface, and a convenient command-line interface, it's features include the ability to: **install newer kernels than those that come with the distribution by default**, view kernel release changelogs, **remove all installed kernels besides the one that's currently running**, and includes desktop notifications for new kernel releases.
