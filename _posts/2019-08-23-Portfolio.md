Forked from an abandoned open-source project of the same name, the Ubuntu Kernel Update Utility ('ukuu') manages kernel updates for Ubuntu-based distributions; including both supported and un-supported kernel releases from directly from Canonical. 

My contributions to the project so far include: bug fixes, code refactoring, and a partialy refreshed user interface. Other features include: a modern GTK3-based graphical user interface, a convinient command-line interface, desktop notifications for new kernel releases, filtering of released based on type, and the ability to view release changelogs from within the application.
