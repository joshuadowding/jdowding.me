Forked from an abandoned open-source project of the same name, the Ubuntu Kernel Update Utility (or "ukuu") manages kernel updates for Ubuntu-based distributions; including both supported and un-supported kernel releases directly from Canonical. With a modern GTK3-based interface, and a convinient command-line interface, it's features include the ability to: **install newer kernels than those that come with the distribution by default**, **view kernel release changelogs**, **remove all installed kernels besides the one thats currently running**, and includes **desktop notifications for new kernel releases**.
