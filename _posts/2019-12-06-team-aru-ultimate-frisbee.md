On Wednesday the 20th of November, the university’s Ultimate Frisbee Team played an away match against Loughborough University. The 3rds game kicked-off at around 3:30 PM with Team ARU on the defence and Loughborough playing aggressively from the get-go.

For the first half, Charlie A., Tom R. and Xico remained in the cup to stop any quick throws coming their way – the majority of which they managed to shut down with ease. Though a few high throws slipped through their defence, these were caught by the combined force of Nick, Tom M. and Richard playing at the back.

With this formation, Team ARU managed to turn over the disc multiple times resulting in a few quick points early on. But Loughborough was quick to retaliate, keeping the scores even until both teams tied at four points each.

It was at this point that Team ARU decided to go on the offence. Their long runs quickly out-manoeuvred Loughborough’s defences, breaching the end zone and running short for quick passes across the field. And by the end of the first half, the points began to slide in Team ARU’s favour. Securing a lead of 8 – 4 by half-time.

The second half began with Team ARU sticking to their offensive strategy. An early fast point extended their lead to 9 – 4, though Loughborough wasn’t about to give in.

As the game continued, Team ARU put up a strong defence against Loughborough’s advances. The lead extended further to 10 – 4 with another fast point scored for Anglia, and over the course of the rest of the game Team ARU capitalized on an increasingly weary Loughborough by taking their score to the hard-cap of 15. Loughborough managed to score one more point before the end of the match, though the result was a triumphant 15 – 6 for Team ARU.

The team came away from the match feeling elated at their victory. It must have been a huge morale boost for Team ARU to win by such a wide margin, and we can only hope that their good fortunes carry on throughout the rest of the season.
