On Wednesday the 20th of November, the university’s Ultimate Frisbee Team played an away match against Loughborough University. The 3rds game kicked-off at around 3:30 PM with Team ARU on the defence and Loughborough playing aggressively from the get-go. For the first half, Charlie A., Tom R. and Xico remained in the cup to stop any quick throws coming their way – the majority of which they managed to shut down with ease. Though a few high throws slipped through their defence, these were caught by the combined force of Nick, Tom M. and Richard playing at the back.
