Built to allow field agents to view up-to-date sales information, customer details and parts information in the browser. Agents could then upload new data to the tool and have it reflected accross the business instantly. This replaced a spreadsheet-based workflow where someone would have to combine everyones up-to-date sales data into one master spreadsheet manually.

Built as an extention to MSX' popular web product Kaleidoscope, my involvement with the project included designing the user interface to a specification and assisting with the backend Java code which was primarily handled by my colleague and co-creator.
