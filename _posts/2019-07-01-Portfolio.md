These tools allowed field agents to **view up-to-date sales numbers, product prices, and customer details from the browser**. Agents could add new entries to these datasets through the same interface and have those changes reflected across the whole business instantly. These tools where built as an extension to an existing product, Kaleidoscope, and my involvement included developing the user interface to a specification, and implementing the view layer logic. This was my first hands-on experience with JavaScript, jQuery and HTTP requests.
