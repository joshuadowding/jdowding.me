## Installation & Deployment
Since we're using Jekyll to build a static website, we'll need to install these [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/) gems:
```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

We'll also need [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/) to install the dependent gems:
```bash
bundle install
```

Once we've cloned the repository, we can navigate to the project directory and run the following command to launch the website locally:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve (optional: --incremental --host 0.0.0.0)
```
