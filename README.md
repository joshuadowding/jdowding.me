Personal website, portfolio and blog.

## Installation & Deployment
Since we're using Jekyll to build this static website, we need [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/) to install the following gems:
~~~
gem install github-packages bundler tzinfo-data wdm rake
~~~
Once we've cloned the repository, we can navigate to the project directory and run the following command to launch the website:
~~~
bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
~~~
